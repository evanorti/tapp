# Terra Application/Protocol Proposals (TAPPs)

## What are TAPPs?

TAPPs are a way to standardize and speed up the development of applications and protocols. TAPPs provide an organizational framework for fleshing out applications pre-production. Think of a TAPP as a blueprint.  Use TAPPs to organize your ideas, flesh out a general overview and analysis of the product, answer key questions, and create a plan for development. 

 A common organizational framework allows for consistent quality and clear standards of practice. Taking the time to organize your ideas will give you more flexibility during development. It's easier to change a word document than it is to change your code. TAPPs will save you time, improve your product quality, and create a better building experience.

## Considerations for buidlers

### Simplicity is key.

More moving parts means more potential for problems. Excessively complex mechanisms are inefficient. Keep your designs lean. Keep your writing concise. Keep your code efficient. 

### Take time to build a solid foundation. 

Quick and dirty is amazing for prototypes, but quality products are built with solid foundations. After prototyping, take a bit of time to think about your foundation. All products evolve from their initial designs. Organize from the start.

### If you don't have time to build it right the first time, you definitely don't have time to build it again. 

Haste makes waste. Work efficiently and don't waste your time reworking poorly thought-out designs. Mistakes and setbacks are inevitable, but poor planning is avoidable. 

### You will not remember your code a few weeks from now. 

Comment your code so you can easily remember it. Think of it as labeling the parts and functions of a machine. Documenting will save yourself and others hours of precious time trying to figure out how something works. Comments do not need to be exhaustive or long, just enough to be clear. Taking 15 minutes to write comments will save 15 hours in the long run.

### Remember you are working in a team

Play to your strengths. 

### Be proactive.

Think ahead. Identify pain points and problems before they arise.

TAPPs don't need to be perfect. Every project is different, and the TAPP template may need to be amended.
